Machine-Learning Project: Content and Context
================

Welcome to my repository for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning Course. The focus of the course was to predict user activity based on data gathered during a Human Activity Recognition experiment. The contents of this repo include

* the R markdown file for the analysis
* a compiled HTML file describing the analysis
* predictions (in the Results section) after applyuing a machine learning algorithm to 20 test cases

According to notes from the course
>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset) (Leek, J., Caffo, B., Peng, R. D. (2014).
